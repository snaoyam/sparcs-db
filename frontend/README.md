# SPARCS 2021 Spring DB Seminar

This project is a fork of [pacokwon/21spring-frontend-seminar](https://github.com/pacokwon/21spring-frontend-seminar), adding a hands-on demo for using the fetch API.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Unnecessary files were removed for ease of demonstration.

To run the project:
```bash
npm start
```
